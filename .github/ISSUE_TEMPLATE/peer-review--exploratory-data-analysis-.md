### Is the data cleaning and data wrangling process clearly described? This includes how the group handled missing data, created new variables, reduced the number of levels for categorical variables, etc.

### Do the visualizations follow the guidelines we've discussed in STA 210? This includes using plots that are appropriate for the data, having proper axis labels, titles, etc. 

### Are any tables and figures clear, effective, and informative? Are they neatly printed with a reasonable number of digits displayed? 

### Should any visualizations, figures, or tables be eliminated, or are there any new visualizations, tables, or figures that should be added?

### Include any additional comments or suggestions for the exploratory data analysis.
